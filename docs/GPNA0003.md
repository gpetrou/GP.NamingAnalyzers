# GPNA0003 #

## Cause ##

The name of a key/value pair should follow the 'xByY' naming convention.

## Rule description ##

A violation of this rule occurs when a key/value pair does not follow the
'xByY' naming convention. For example:

```csharp

```

The name should be more descriptive:

```csharp
private KeyValuePair<int, string> _itemNameById;
```

## How to fix violations ##

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the key/value pair to follow
the naming convention.

## How to suppress violations ##

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("GP.NamingAnalyzers", "GPNA0003", Justification = "We should not follow the naming convention in this case.")]
```

or

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GPNA0003
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GPNA0003
```
