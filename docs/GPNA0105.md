# GPNA0105 #

## Cause ##

The name of a method that returns a boolean should follow the 'Can|Has|Is'
naming convention. If the `dotnet_diagnostic.GPNA0105.pattern` option value is
set, then it should match the provided regex pattern.

## Rule description ##

A violation of this rule occurs when the names of methods that return a boolean
do not follow the 'Can|Has|Is' naming convention.

```csharp
public bool GetBoolean()
{
    return false;
}
```

The name should be more descriptive:

```csharp
public bool IsValid()
{
    return false;
}
```

## How to fix violations ##

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the method to follow the
naming convention.

## How to suppress violations ##

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("GP.NamingAnalyzers", "GPNA0105", Justification = "We should not follow the naming convention in this case.")]
```

or

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GPNA0105
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GPNA0105
```
