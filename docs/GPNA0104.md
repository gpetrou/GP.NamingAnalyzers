# GPNA0104 #

## Cause ##

The name of a method that returns a set should follow the 'GetUniqueXs'
naming convention. If the `dotnet_diagnostic.GPNA0104.pattern` option value is
set, then it should match the provided regex pattern.

## Rule description ##

A violation of this rule occurs when the names of methods that return a set
do not follow the 'GetUniqueXs' naming convention.

```csharp
public HashSet<string> GetHashSet()
{
    return new HashSet<string>();
}
```

The name should be more descriptive:

```csharp
public HashSet<string> GetUniqueItems()
{
    return new HashSet<string>();
}
```

## How to fix violations ##

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the method to follow the
naming convention.

## How to suppress violations ##

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("GP.NamingAnalyzers", "GPNA0104", Justification = "We should not follow the naming convention in this case.")]
```

or

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GPNA0104
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GPNA0104
```
