# GPNA0001 #

## Cause ##

The name of a dictionary should follow the 'xsByY' naming convention.

## Rule description ##

A violation of this rule occurs when a dictionary does not follow the 'xsByY'
naming convention. For example:

```

The name should be more descriptive:

private Dictionary<int, string> _itemNamesById;
```

## How to fix violations ##

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the dictionary to follow the
naming convention.

## How to suppress violations ##

[SuppressMessage("GP.NamingAnalyzers", "GPNA0001", Justification = "We should not follow the naming convention in this case.")]
```

or

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GPNA0001
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GPNA0001
```
