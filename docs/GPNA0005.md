# GPNA0005 #

## Cause ##

The name of a mocked member should follow the 'mocked' naming convention.
If the `dotnet_diagnostic.GPNA0005.pattern` option value is set, then it
should match the provided regex pattern.

## Rule description ##

A violation of this rule occurs when a mocked member does not follow the
'mocked' naming convention. For example:

```csharp
var item = new Mock<IItem>;
```

The name should indicate that this is a mocked member:

```csharp
var mockedItem = new Mock<IItem>;
```

## How to fix violations ##

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the mocked member to follow
the naming convention.

## How to suppress violations ##

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("GP.NamingAnalyzers", "GPNA0005", Justification = "We should not follow the naming convention in this case.")]
```

or

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GPNA0005
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GPNA0005
```
