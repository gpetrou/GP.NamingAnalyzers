# GPNA0002 #

## Cause ##

The name of a set should follow the 'uniqueXs' naming convention.
If the `dotnet_diagnostic.GPNA0002.pattern` option value is set, then it
should match the provided regex pattern.

## Rule description ##

A violation of this rule occurs when a set does not follow the 'uniqueXs'
naming convention. For example:

```csharp
private HashSet<int> _myHashSet;
```

The name should be more descriptive:

```csharp
private HashSet<int> _uniqueIds;
```

## How to fix violations ##

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the set to follow the
naming convention.

## How to suppress violations ##

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("GP.NamingAnalyzers", "GPNA0002", Justification = "We should not follow the naming convention in this case.")]
```

or

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GPNA0002
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GPNA0002
```
