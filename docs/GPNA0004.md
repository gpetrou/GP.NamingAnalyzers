# GPNA0004 #

## Cause ##

The name of a boolean should follow the 'can|has|is' naming convention.
If the `dotnet_diagnostic.GPNA0004.pattern` option value is set, then it
should match the provided regex pattern.

## Rule description ##

A violation of this rule occurs when a boolean does not follow the
'can|has|is' naming convention. For example:

```csharp
private bool _myBoolean;
```

The name should be more descriptive:

```csharp
private bool _isValid;
```

## How to fix violations ##

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the boolean to follow the
naming convention.

## How to suppress violations ##

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("GP.NamingAnalyzers", "GPNA0004", Justification = "We should not follow the naming convention in this case.")]
```

or

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GPNA0004
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GPNA0004
```
