# GPNA0101 #

## Cause ##

The test method should follow the 'MethodUnderTest_When_Should' naming convention.
If the `dotnet_diagnostic.GPNA0101.pattern` option value is set, then it
should match the provided regex pattern.

## Rule description ##

A violation of this rule occurs when the names of test methods do not follow the
'MethodUnderTest_When_Should' naming convention.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Test()
{
}
```

The name should be more descriptive:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void CheckValue_WhenInputIsInvalid_ShouldReturnFalse()
{
}
```

## How to fix violations ##

To fix a violation of this rule, change the name of the test method to follow the
naming convention.

## How to suppress violations ##

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("GP.NamingAnalyzers", "GPNA0101", Justification = "We should not follow the naming convention in this case.")]
```

or

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GPNA0101
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GPNA0101
```
